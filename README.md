CONTRACT

Contract DssVest : Is an abstract contract in which at least one of its function interface is not implemented and it is marked with the keyword “abstract”.

Mapping : Is a reference type variable.
Public : It is a state visibility that a function or state variable can be access within and outside its existing contract.
wards : Is a mapping with a visibility of public, key type of address and a value type of uint256,located at position 0 and occupies a 32bytes storage slot.

awards : Is a mapping with a visibility of public , key type of uint256 and value type of struct (Award), located at postion 2 and occupies a 32bytes storage slot.
Struct

Award : Is a struct located at position 1, occupies 3 storage slot and contains the following state variables
address usr : as vesting recipient and on the first storage slot.
uint48 bgn : as the start vesting period and on the first storage slot.
uint48 clf : as the cliff date and on the first storage slot.
uint48 fin : as the end of vesting period and on the 2nd storage slot.

uint8 res : as the restriction variable and on the 2nd storage slot.
uint128 tot : as the total reward amount from the vest and on the 3rd storage slot.
uint128 rxd : as the amount of vest claimed and on the 3rd storage slot.

State Variables : are value type data types declared as global variables with in a contract which can have state visibility of either public, internal or private.
Internal : It is a state visibility that a function or state variable can be access only within its existing contract.
Constant : are state variables initialized at compliation time and copied to every location of the state variable. It is used to save gas.
Cap : a value type uint256 state variable, located at postion 3 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and It is the maximum per-second issuance token rate of the contract.
ids : a value type uint256 state variable, located at position 4 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and It is the total vestings of the contract.
locked :  a value type uint256 state variable, located at position 5 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of internal.
TWENTY_YEARS :  a constant value type uint256 state variable, located at position 6 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and it is the time period in which the vesting will last.
Events : It is used to allow logging to the ethereum blockchain.

Constructor : Initialized the msg.sender as the owner at construction time and emit the address of the msg.sender using the “Event Rely”.
MODIFIER

lock : A modifier to lock the vest.
    • It checks that  “locked” is false with “require” keyword. 
    • sets “locked” to true in order to lock the function.
    • “_;” allows for the execution of other codes of the function and then set “locked” to false.
auth : A modifier to check that msg.sender is owner of the contract.
    • It checks that  “msg.sender” is owner with  “require” keyword. 
    • “_;” allows for the execution of other codes of the function.
