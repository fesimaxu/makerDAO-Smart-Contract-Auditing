## Pragma solidity 0.6.12 
```solidity
pragma solidity 0.6.12;
```
### The compiler version used to compile the contract by the EVM compiler.

## Interface 
### are contracts that contains function signatures without the function definition implementation and are identified using the “interface” keyword.
```solidity
interface MintLike {
    function mint(address, uint256) external;
}

interface ChainlogLike {
    function getAddress(bytes32) external view returns (address);
}

interface DaiJoinLike {
    function exit(address, uint256) external;
}

interface VatLike {
    function hope(address) external;
    function suck(address, address, uint256) external;
    function live() external view returns (uint256);
}

interface TokenLike {
    function transferFrom(address, address, uint256) external returns (bool);
}
```
## External Function 
### It is a function visibility that the function can only be access from outside its existing contract.

## View Function 
### It is a function state mutability that promise not to modify the state but can only read the state.

### Interface MintLike 
### Provides a minting function interface to mint token.

### _mint: function mint is a external function signature of MintLike for minting token with address(user address) and uint256(amount)._

## Interface ChainlogLike 
### Provides a function signature to read a bytes32 state variable and returns address as the output.

### _getAddress : function getAddress is an external view function signature of ChainlogLike that accepts a bytes32 parameter and returns address as output._ 

### Interface DaiJoinLike 
### Provides a function signature to exit contracts.
### _exit : function exit is an external function signature of DaiJoinLike that accepts address and uint256 as parameter to trigger exit operation in a contract._

### Interface VatLike 
### Provides three(3) function signatures of hope,suck and live to perform operation on address, uint256 and read a state variable.
### _hope : function hope is an external function signature that accepts an address as a parameter._
### _suck : function suck is an external function signature that accepts address from, address to and uint256 amount._
### _live : function live is an external view function signature that returns uint256(amount) as ouput value._
### Interface TokenLike 
### Provides a function signature of transferFrom.
### _transferFrom : function transferFrom is an external function signature thats accepts parameters of address from, address to and unit256 amount which allows transfer of amount between token accounts within a contract and returns true on success and false on failure._
## CONTRACT
```solidity
abstract contract DssVest {}
```
### Contract DssVest 
### Is an abstract contract in which at least one of its function interface is not implemented and it is marked with the keyword “abstract”.

## Mapping 
### Is a reference type variable.
## Public 
### It is a state visibility that a function or state variable can be access within and outside its existing contract.
```solidity
mapping (address => uint256) public wards;
```
### wards : Is a mapping with a visibility of public, key type of address and a value type of uint256,located at position 0 and occupies a 32bytes storage slot.
```solidity
 mapping (uint256 => Award) public awards;
```
### awards : Is a mapping with a visibility of public , key type of uint256 and value type of struct (Award), located at postion 2 and occupies a 32bytes storage slot.
## Struct
```solidity
     struct Award {
        address usr;   // Vesting recipient
        uint48  bgn;   // Start of vesting period  [timestamp]
        uint48  clf;   // The cliff date           [timestamp]
        uint48  fin;   // End of vesting period    [timestamp]
        address mgr;   // A manager address that can yank
        uint8   res;   // Restricted
        uint128 tot;   // Total reward amount
        uint128 rxd;   // Amount of vest claimed
    }
```
### Award : Is a struct located at position 1, occupies 3 storage slot and contains the following state variables
* _address usr : as vesting recipient and on the first storage slot._
* _uint48 bgn : as the start vesting period and on the first storage slot._
* _uint48 clf : as the cliff date and on the first storage slot._
* _uint48 fin : as the end of vesting period and on the 2nd storage slot._
* _address mgr : as the manager address that can control the contract and on the 2nd storage slot._
* _uint8 res : as the restriction variable and on the 2nd storage slot._
* _uint128 tot : as the total reward amount from the vest and on the 3rd storage slot._
* _uint128 rxd : as the amount of vest claimed and on the 3rd storage slot._

## State Variables 
### are value type data types declared as global variables with in a contract which can have state visibility of either public, internal or private.
```solidity
    uint256 public cap; 

    uint256 public ids; 
    uint256 internal locked;

    uint256 public constant  TWENTY_YEARS = 20 * 365 days;
```
## Internal
### It is a state visibility that a function or state variable can be access only within its existing contract.
## Constant 
### are state variables initialized at compliation time and copied to every location of the state variable. It is used to save gas.
### _Cap : a value type uint256 state variable, located at postion 3 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and It is the maximum per-second issuance token rate of the contract._
### _ids : a value type uint256 state variable, located at position 4 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and It is the total vestings of the contract._
### _locked :  a value type uint256 state variable, located at position 5 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of internal._
### _TWENTY_YEARS :  a constant value type uint256 state variable, located at position 6 and occupies 1 storage slot of 32 bytes. It has state visibility of public and it is the time period in which the vesting will last._
## Events 
### It is used to allow logging to the ethereum blockchain.
```solidity
    event Rely(address indexed usr);
    event Deny(address indexed usr);

    event File(bytes32 indexed what, uint256 data);

    event Init(uint256 indexed id, address indexed usr);
    event Vest(uint256 indexed id, uint256 amt);
    event Restrict(uint256 indexed id);
    event Unrestrict(uint256 indexed id);
    event Yank(uint256 indexed id, uint256 end);
    event Move(uint256 indexed id, address indexed dst);
```
- Event Rely : To emit/log addresses.
- Event Deny : To emit addresses.
- Event File : To emit byte32 and uint256 values.
- Event Init : To emit uint256 and address values.
- Event Vest : To emit uint256 values.
- Event Restrict : To log uint256 values.
- Event Unrestrict : To log uint256 values.
- Event Yank : To log uint256 values.
- Event Move : To log uint256 values.

## Constructor 
```solidity
   constructor() public {
        wards[msg.sender] = 1;
        emit Rely(msg.sender);
    }
```
### Initialized the msg.sender as the owner at construction time and emit the address of the msg.sender using the “Event Rely”.
## MODIFIER
```solidity
    modifier lock {
        require(locked == 0, "DssVest/system-locked");
        locked = 1;
        _;
        locked = 0;
    }

    modifier auth {
        require(wards[msg.sender] == 1, "DssVest/not-authorized");
        _;
    }
```
### lock : A modifier to lock the vest.
    - It checks that  “locked” is false with “require” keyword. 
    - sets “locked” to true in order to lock the function.
    - “_;” allows for the execution of other codes of the function and then set “locked” to false.
### auth : A modifier to check that msg.sender is owner of the contract.
    - It checks that  “msg.sender” is owner with  “require” keyword. 
    - “_;” allows for the execution of other codes of the function.
